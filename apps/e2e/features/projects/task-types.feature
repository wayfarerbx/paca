Feature: Task types management
  Project members with the appropriate permissions can configure the set of
  task types used to categorise work in a project.  Types are managed from
  Settings > Task Types on the project settings page.  Each type has a
  required name, an optional icon chosen from a preset library (Bug,
  Feature, Story, Epic, Task, Idea, Security, Chore, Branch, Critical,
  Important, Goal, Warning, Doc, Feedback, Package, Build, Test,
  Improvement, Refactor, Generic, Ticket, Checklist), an optional colour,
  and an optional description.  A default set of user-manageable types
  (Bug, Story, Task) is created with every new project.  Two system types
  (Epic, Subtask) are also seeded at project creation; these are read-only
  and cannot be created, edited, or deleted by users.
