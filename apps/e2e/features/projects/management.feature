Feature: Project management
  Projects are the primary workspace unit in the workspace. Visibility,
  creation, editing, deletion, and member or role management are each gated
  by distinct global or project-scoped permissions. The project list lives
  on the home page; all per-project settings are accessed through the
  project's own Settings page.

      Given the user already has a stored authenticated session
      And the user is on the "E2E_ROLES_PROJECT" project roles settings page
      And a project role named "E2E_DELETABLE_ROLE" exists in the project

    Scenario: Confirming deletion removes the project role
      When the user clicks the "Delete role" button for "E2E_DELETABLE_ROLE"
      Then a delete confirmation dialog should open
      And the dialog should display the name "E2E_DELETABLE_ROLE"
      When the user confirms deletion
      Then the role "E2E_DELETABLE_ROLE" should no longer appear in the project roles table
      And the statistics bar should reflect the updated role and permission counts

    Scenario: Cancelling the delete dialog preserves the project role
      When the user clicks the "Delete role" button for "E2E_DELETABLE_ROLE"
      And the user cancels deletion
      Then the role "E2E_DELETABLE_ROLE" should still appear in the project roles table

  @authenticated
  Rule: Access control for project roles settings

    Scenario: Users with "Manage Roles" project permission see the New role button and edit/delete actions
      Given the user has the "Manage Roles" project role in "E2E_ROLES_PROJECT"
      When the user navigates to the "E2E_ROLES_PROJECT" project roles settings page
      Then the "New role" button should be visible
      And "Edit role" and "Delete role" buttons should be visible on each role row

    Scenario: Users without role management permission see roles but cannot modify them
      Given the user does not have role management permission in "E2E_ROLES_PROJECT"
      When the user navigates to the "E2E_ROLES_PROJECT" project roles settings page
      Then the "New role" button should not be visible
      And no "Edit role" or "Delete role" buttons should be visible

    Scenario: User without project access cannot reach the project roles settings page
      Given the user does not have the "Read All Projects" global permission
      And the user is not a member of project "E2E_ROLES_PROJECT"
      When the user navigates directly to the "E2E_ROLES_PROJECT" project roles settings URL
      Then the user should see an access-denied message
