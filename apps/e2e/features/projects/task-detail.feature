Feature: Task detail
  The task detail view is the primary interface for viewing and editing a
  single task.  It opens as a modal dialog when a task card (Board view)
  or task row (Table view) is clicked, and as a standalone page when
  navigated to via a direct URL.  Both renderings share the same two-pane
  layout: a scrollable content pane on the left (title, a unified
  properties section, description, subtasks, checklists, and attachments)
  and an activity pane on the right (event log and comment thread).
  The unified properties section renders all built-in fields and every
  project-defined custom field together in a single two-column grid —
  custom fields do not appear in a separate section.
