Feature: Interaction views (board and list layouts)
  Each project interaction (product backlog or a sprint) can be explored
  through one or more saved views.  A view defines a named layout — Table,
  Board, or Roadmap — and persists the user's preferred way of looking at work
  items.  Each view also stores display settings (visible fields, column
  grouping, swimlanes, sort order, field sum, and slice dimension).  The
  default view opened when entering the product backlog is the Table view
  grouped by sprint (column_by = "sprint"); for sprint interactions it is the
  first view in the tab bar.  On the product backlog Table view every sprint
  column header shows a "Start sprint" button for planned sprints, allowing
  the user to open the Start Sprint modal without leaving the backlog.  The
  product backlog page header and each sprint-column header also contain a
  "New sprint" button that quick-creates a sprint with a system-generated
  default name (no modal).  Epic and Subtask tasks are excluded from both
  the product backlog and sprint views.  Users with sufficient permissions
  may create additional views, rename or delete them, and switch freely
  between layouts.  An "Add view" (+) button sits to the right of the last
  view tab; a separate "View settings" button in the view toolbar opens a
  settings panel for the active view.  Creating tasks is available inline
  from both Table and Board views.

      And the user has the "View Sprints" project permission in "E2E_FILTER_PROJECT"
      And the user has navigated to the "Product Backlog" board view inside "E2E_FILTER_PROJECT"

    Scenario: A search or filter bar is visible at the top of the interaction view
      Then a filter or search control should be visible in the view toolbar

    Scenario: Searching by keyword filters visible tasks across all columns
      Given the interaction has tasks "E2E_ALPHA_TASK" and "E2E_BETA_TASK"
      When the user types "ALPHA" in the search bar
      Then only cards matching "ALPHA" should be visible
      And the card for "E2E_BETA_TASK" should not be visible

    Scenario: Filtering by assignee shows only tasks assigned to that user
      Given the interaction has a task "E2E_OWNED_TASK" assigned to "E2E_FILTER_USER"
      And the interaction has a task "E2E_OTHER_TASK" assigned to "E2E_OTHER_USER"
      When the user opens the filter panel and selects assignee "E2E_FILTER_USER"
      Then the card for "E2E_OWNED_TASK" should be visible
      And the card for "E2E_OTHER_TASK" should not be visible

    Scenario: Clearing the filter restores all tasks
      Given the user has applied a keyword filter "E2E_ALPHA"
      When the user clears the filter
      Then all tasks should be visible again

  Rule: View settings panel

    Background:
      Given the user already has a stored authenticated session
      And a project named "E2E_SETTINGS_PROJECT" exists
      And the project has a "Product Backlog" interaction with at least one view
      And the user has the "View Sprints" project permission in "E2E_SETTINGS_PROJECT"
      And the user has navigated to the "Product Backlog" interaction inside "E2E_SETTINGS_PROJECT"

    Scenario: Clicking the "View settings" button opens a settings panel
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      Then a settings panel should appear
      And the panel should display a "Fields" row
      And the panel should display a "Column by" row
      And the panel should display a "Swimlanes" row
      And the panel should display a "Sort by" row
      And the panel should display a "Field sum" row
      And the panel should display a "Slice by" row

    Scenario: The "Fields" row shows the currently visible field names
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      Then the "Fields" row should list the names of visible fields (e.g. "Title, Assignees, Status")

    Scenario: Changing "Column by" regroups task columns by a different field
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      And the user changes "Column by" to "Assignee"
      Then task groups or columns should be reorganised by assignee

    Scenario: Changing "Sort by" to a field name sorts tasks automatically
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      And the user changes "Sort by" to "Priority"
      Then tasks within each group should be ordered by priority
      And the "Sort by" row should show the value "Priority"

    Scenario: Changing "Sort by" to "Manual" shows the manual value and enables drag-to-reorder
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      And the user sets "Sort by" to "Manual"
      Then the "Sort by" row should show the value "manual"
      And task rows should become draggable for manual reordering

    Scenario: Changing "Swimlanes" groups tasks into horizontal swimlane bands
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      And the user changes "Swimlanes" to "Assignee"
      Then task rows or cards should be further grouped into horizontal swimlane bands by assignee

    Scenario: The "Field sum" setting defaults to "Count" showing per-group task totals
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      Then the "Field sum" row should show the default value "Count"
      And each group heading should display the number of tasks in that group

    Scenario: Changing "Field sum" to a numeric field shows the aggregate in group headings
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      And the user changes "Field sum" to "Story Points"
      Then each group heading should display the total story points for tasks in that group

    Scenario: The settings popup has Save and Reset buttons
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      Then a settings popup should appear near the toolbar
      And the popup should contain a "Save" button
      And the popup should contain a "Reset" button

    Scenario: Changes in the settings popup preview immediately in the view
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      And the user changes "Sort by" to "Manual"
      Then the view should update immediately to reflect the manual sort order
      And the change should not yet be persisted to the server

    Scenario: Clicking Save persists the settings and closes the popup
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      And the user changes "Sort by" to "Manual"
      And the user clicks the "Save" button
      Then the settings popup should close
      And the view's "Sort by" setting should be saved as "Manual"
      And the view should still reflect the manual sort order

    Scenario: Clicking Reset reverts the draft to the last saved settings
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      And the user changes "Sort by" to "Manual"
      And the user clicks the "Reset" button
      Then the "Sort by" field should revert to the previously saved value
      And the view should revert to reflect the previously saved settings

    Scenario: Closing the popup without saving discards unsaved changes
      When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
      And the user changes "Sort by" to "Manual"
      When the user clicks outside the popup or presses Escape
      Then the settings popup should close
      And the view should revert to the settings as they were before the popup was opened

    Scenario: View settings are persisted per view
      Given the user has set "Sort by" to "Priority" on the "Board" view and saved
      When the user switches to a "Table" view and then returns to the "Board" view
      Then the "Sort by" setting on the "Board" view should still show "Priority"

  Rule: Reordering view tabs by dragging

    Background:
      Given the user already has a stored authenticated session
      And a project named "E2E_REORDER_PROJECT" exists
      And the project has a "Product Backlog" interaction with views "Board", "Table", and "Roadmap" (in that order)
      And the user has the "Manage Views" project permission in "E2E_REORDER_PROJECT"
      And the user has navigated to the "Product Backlog" interaction inside "E2E_REORDER_PROJECT"

    Scenario: View tabs show a draggable indicator on hover
      When the user hovers over the "Table" view tab
      Then the tab should indicate it is draggable (e.g. a grab cursor or visible drag handle)

    Scenario: Dragging a view tab to a new position reorders the tab bar
      Given the view tabs are ordered "Board", "Table", "Roadmap"
      When the user drags the "Roadmap" tab and drops it before the "Board" tab
      Then the view tabs should be reordered to "Roadmap", "Board", "Table"

    Scenario: Dropping a view tab on its original position leaves the order unchanged
      Given the view tabs are ordered "Board", "Table", "Roadmap"
      When the user drags the "Table" tab and drops it back in the same position
      Then the view tabs should remain in the order "Board", "Table", "Roadmap"

    Scenario: The reordered tab order persists after a page refresh
      Given the user has dragged the "Roadmap" tab to the first position
      When the user refreshes the page
      Then the view tabs should still appear with "Roadmap" as the first tab

    Scenario: The first tab after reordering becomes the default view for the interaction
      Given the user has dragged the "Table" tab to the first position and refreshed the page
      When the user navigates away from the interaction and returns to it
      Then the "Table" view tab should be active by default

    Scenario: User without "Manage Views" permission cannot drag view tabs
      Given the user does not have the "Manage Views" project permission
      When the user attempts to drag the "Table" view tab to a different position
      Then the drag operation should not be permitted
      And the view tab order should remain unchanged

  @authenticated
  Rule: Manual task sort order within a view

    Background:
      Given the user already has a stored authenticated session
      And a project named "E2E_MANUAL_SORT_PROJECT" exists
      And the project has a "Product Backlog" interaction with a "Table" view configured with "Sort by: Manual"
      And the user has the "Edit Tasks" project permission in "E2E_MANUAL_SORT_PROJECT"
      And the user has navigated to the "Product Backlog" table view inside "E2E_MANUAL_SORT_PROJECT"

    Scenario: Table rows show a drag handle when the view sort order is manual
      Then each task row should show a drag handle icon on the left side

    Scenario: Dragging a task row reorders it within its status group
      Given the interaction has tasks "E2E_TASK_A", "E2E_TASK_B", "E2E_TASK_C" in the "Todo" group in that order
      When the user drags "E2E_TASK_A" below "E2E_TASK_C" within the "Todo" group
      Then the row order in the "Todo" group should be "E2E_TASK_B", "E2E_TASK_C", "E2E_TASK_A"

    Scenario: Manual row order persists after page refresh
      Given the user has manually reordered tasks so "E2E_FIRST_TASK" appears first in the "Todo" group
      When the user refreshes the page
      Then "E2E_FIRST_TASK" should still appear first in the "Todo" group

    Scenario: Board view with manual sort allows vertical reordering of cards within a column
      Given the "Product Backlog" has a "Board" view configured with "Sort by: Manual"
      And the "Todo" column contains tasks "E2E_BOARD_A" above "E2E_BOARD_B"
      When the user drags "E2E_BOARD_A" below "E2E_BOARD_B" within the "Todo" column
      Then "E2E_BOARD_B" should appear above "E2E_BOARD_A" in the "Todo" column

    Scenario: Manual card order in board columns persists after page refresh
      Given the "Product Backlog" has a "Board" view configured with "Sort by: Manual"
      And the user has manually placed "E2E_TOP_CARD" at the top of the "In Progress" column
      When the user refreshes the page
      Then "E2E_TOP_CARD" should still appear at the top of the "In Progress" column

    Scenario: Task rows are not manually draggable when sort order is not manual
      Given the "Product Backlog" interaction has a "Table" view configured with "Sort by: Priority"
      When the user navigates to that view
      Then task rows should not show drag handles
      And attempting to drag a task row should not reorder it

    Scenario: User without "Edit Tasks" permission cannot manually reorder tasks
      Given the user does not have the "Edit Tasks" project permission
      Then task rows in the manual-sort table view should not show drag handles
