Feature: Timeline interaction (Epic roadmap)
  The Timeline is a dedicated project interaction accessible from the project
  sidebar under the "Interactions" section, appearing above "Product Backlog"
  and all sprint entries.  Its purpose is long-horizon planning of Epics on a
  Gantt-style roadmap.  When a user opens the Timeline the page header shows
  "Timeline" with the subtitle "Epics and long-horizon planning on a roadmap."
  The default and only pre-configured view uses the Roadmap layout.  The
  Timeline view settings pre-filter to show only the "Epic" system task type;
  normal task types (Story, Bug, Task, etc.) are excluded by default.  The
  timeline canvas renders a month-based horizontal bar chart — each visible
  Epic appears as a bar spanning its start-date to due-date range.  When no
  Epics exist an empty-state message "No tasks to display" is shown.  An
  "Add task" button at the bottom of the canvas creates new Epic tasks inline.
  Users may add Board or Table views to the Timeline interaction in addition
  to the default Roadmap view.  The view settings "Column by" dropdown
  defaults to "Status" (not "Sprint") for the Timeline interaction.  The
  Timeline interaction does not show any sprint-related controls (no "New
  sprint" button, no sprint columns, no "Start sprint" button).

  Rule: Timeline interaction page header and navigation

    Background:
      Given the user already has a stored authenticated session
      And a project named "E2E_TIMELINE_PROJECT" exists
      And the user has the "View Sprints" project permission in "E2E_TIMELINE_PROJECT"
      And the user has navigated to the "E2E_TIMELINE_PROJECT" project

    Scenario: Timeline appears as the first entry in the Interactions sidebar section
      Then the project sidebar should contain a "Timeline" entry in the Interactions section
      And the "Timeline" entry should appear above "Product Backlog" and any sprint entries

    Scenario: Clicking Timeline in the sidebar opens the Timeline interaction page
      When the user clicks "Timeline" in the project sidebar
      Then the page URL should contain "/interactions/timeline"
      And the "Timeline" sidebar entry should be marked as active

    Scenario: Timeline page heading is "Timeline"
      When the user navigates to the Timeline interaction
      Then the page heading should display "Timeline"

    Scenario: Timeline page subtitle reads "Epics and long-horizon planning on a roadmap."
      When the user navigates to the Timeline interaction
      Then the page subtitle should read "Epics and long-horizon planning on a roadmap."

    Scenario: Timeline does not show a "New sprint" button
      When the user navigates to the Timeline interaction
      Then no "New sprint" button should be visible on the Timeline page

  Rule: Timeline default Roadmap view

    Background:
      Given the user already has a stored authenticated session
      And a project named "E2E_TIMELINE_VIEW_PROJECT" exists
      And the user has the "View Sprints" project permission in "E2E_TIMELINE_VIEW_PROJECT"
      And the user has navigated to the Timeline interaction inside "E2E_TIMELINE_VIEW_PROJECT"

    Scenario: Timeline opens with the Roadmap view active by default
      Then the "Roadmap" view tab should be active
      And the Roadmap (Gantt-style timeline) layout should be displayed

    Scenario: Timeline Roadmap view shows a month-based horizontal axis
      Then the timeline canvas should display at least one month label on the horizontal axis

    Scenario: Timeline empty state shows "No tasks to display" when no Epics exist
      Given the project has no Epic tasks
      Then the message "No tasks to display" should be visible in the timeline canvas

    Scenario: An "Add task" button is visible at the bottom of the Timeline canvas
      Then an "Add task" button should be present below the timeline canvas

    Scenario: Timeline Roadmap view shows a task list panel on the left side
      Then a left-side panel with the label "Task" should be visible alongside the timeline canvas

    Scenario: Each Epic appears as a horizontal bar spanning its scheduled date range
      Given the project has an Epic named "E2E_EPIC_BAR" with start date "2026-04-01" and due date "2026-04-30"
      Then a bar labelled "E2E_EPIC_BAR" should be visible in the April column range of the timeline
      And the bar should span from the start date to the due date

    Scenario: Epics without dates appear in the task list but show no bar on the canvas
      Given the project has an Epic named "E2E_EPIC_NO_DATES" with no start date and no due date
      Then "E2E_EPIC_NO_DATES" should appear in the left-side task list
      And no bar should be rendered for "E2E_EPIC_NO_DATES" on the timeline canvas

  Rule: Timeline pre-filters to Epic task types only

    Background:

      And the user has the "View Sprints" project permission in "E2E_TIMELINE_FILTER_PROJECT"
      And the user has navigated to the Timeline interaction inside "E2E_TIMELINE_FILTER_PROJECT"

    Scenario: Timeline view settings default to showing only Epic task type
      When the user opens the View settings panel
      Then under "Task types" the "Epic" checkbox should be checked
      And the "Story", "Bug", and "Task" type checkboxes should be unchecked

    Scenario: Only Epics appear in the Timeline Roadmap view by default
      Given the project has an Epic "E2E_TL_EPIC" and a Story "E2E_TL_STORY"
      Then "E2E_TL_EPIC" should appear in the timeline task list
      And "E2E_TL_STORY" should not appear in the timeline task list

    Scenario: Adding a normal task type in view settings makes those tasks appear
      When the user opens the View settings panel
      And the user checks the "Story" task type checkbox
      And the user clicks "Save"
      Then tasks of type "Story" should appear in the timeline task list alongside Epics
