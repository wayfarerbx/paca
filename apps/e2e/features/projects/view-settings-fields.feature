Feature: View settings — field visibility on Board and List views
  A user can choose which task fields (built-in and custom) appear on Board
  cards and as List columns through the "Fields" picker inside the View
  settings panel.  "Title" is always visible and cannot be hidden.  On the
  Board layout, enabled fields are displayed below the title on each task card
  in the order defined in the picker.  On the Table (List) layout, each
  enabled field renders as a sortable column, also in picker order.  The
  default visible fields are: Title (locked), Assignee, Status, Importance,
  and Type.  Custom fields of any type (text, number, date, select,
  multi_select, boolean, url) can be toggled on or off alongside built-in
  fields.  Field settings are persisted independently per view.

  Background:
    Given the user already has a stored authenticated session
    And a project named "E2E_FIELDS_PROJECT" exists
    And the project has a "Product Backlog" interaction with at least one Board view and one Table view
    And the user has the "View Sprints" project permission in "E2E_FIELDS_PROJECT"
    And the user has navigated to the "Product Backlog" interaction inside "E2E_FIELDS_PROJECT"

  Rule: Field picker — content and interaction
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Scenario: Opening the field picker lists all built-in fields
    When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar

    And the project has a custom field "Severity" of type "select" with options "Low,Medium,High"
    And the project has a custom field "Is Blocked" of type "boolean"

    And the user clicks the "Fields" row
    Then the field picker should include: "Story Points", "Severity", "Is Blocked", "Target Date", "Notes", "Reference URL", and "Labels"

  Scenario: Enabled fields are shown in a draggable checked section; disabled in an unchecked greyed section
    When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
    And the user clicks the "Fields" row
    Then the field picker should display checked (enabled) fields in the top section
    And the checked fields should each have a drag handle for reordering
    And the field picker should display unchecked (disabled) fields in the bottom section
    And the unchecked fields should appear visually greyed out

  Scenario: The default visible fields are Title, Assignee, Status, Importance, and Type
    When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
    And the user clicks the "Fields" row
    Then the following fields should be checked by default:

    When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
    And the user clicks the "Fields" row

    Then the table view should display the "Due Date" column
    And the table view should not display the "Importance" column

  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Rule: Newly added or deleted custom fields are reflected in the field picker
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Scenario: Creating a new custom field makes it available in the field picker
    Given the project initially has no custom fields
    And the user creates a custom field "Priority Score" of type "number"
    When the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
    And the user clicks the "Fields" row

    And the view has "Obsolete Field" enabled
    When the user deletes the "Obsolete Field" custom field
    And the user clicks the "View settings" button in the view toolbar
