    """A chat conversation's sandbox, kept alive between user turns.

    Populated when a chat_message conversation reaches a natural per-turn
    finish or an interrupt-only pause (status "paused") instead of being torn
    down; consumed on the next reply to reattach without re-cloning/
    re-starting. Removed (and the sandbox stopped) on an explicit stop or by
    the idle reaper. `last_active_at` is refreshed by turn completion,
    interrupt-only pauses, and periodic frontend heartbeats — not just by
    sending a message — so the reaper only reclaims genuinely disconnected
    sessions.

    Multi-replica note: same caveat as `active_conversations` above — this is
    per-process only.
