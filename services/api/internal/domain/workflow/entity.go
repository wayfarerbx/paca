// Package workflowdom defines the automation-workflow aggregate and its
// domain contracts.
//
// A Workflow is a project-scoped, draft/active/archived dependency graph
// over existing tasks. Each WorkflowNode wraps one task; WorkflowEdge is a
// plain dependency link between two nodes with no per-edge configuration.
// A workflow also carries two shared, workflow-level (not per-node) lookup
// tables:
//
//   - StatusRule — maps a status to the member who should be auto-assigned
//     when any task in the workflow reaches that status.
//   - StatusTransition — the "status workflow": maps a status to the status
//     that should come next once work at that status is done, so an
//     AI-agent assignee can be told exactly what to set next instead of
//     guessing. The workflow's single "done" status is DERIVED from this
//     chain — whichever status has no next status configured (see
//     DeriveDoneStatusID) — rather than being its own field.
//
// Both automation events reuse the same status->assignee lookup:
//
//   - Event 1 (status changed): a task's new status is looked up in the
//     workflow's rules and, if found, the task is reassigned.
//   - Event 2 (predecessor done): once a node's task reaches the workflow's
//     derived done status (and, for nodes with multiple incoming edges,
//     once ALL predecessors have reached theirs), each downstream node's
//     task is reassigned using ITS OWN current status against the same
//     workflow rules — no status is changed on the downstream task.
